### FizzBuzz TDD Demo

This solution to the classic FizzBuzz game was written to demonstrate a TDD approach.  

Refer to the git history for the path I took:

    * ba933b8 2015-04-28 | Refactored to move conditional logic to separate descriptive methods (HEAD, origin/master, master) [Ptolemy]
    * 61c9906 2015-04-28 | refactor tests with further cases of each category of number [Ptolemy]
    * bf17402 2015-04-28 | Passed test: returns number when number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5 [Ptolemy]
    * c85efe9 2015-04-28 | Passed test: it can 'FizzBuzz' when passed number divisible by both 3 and 5 [Ptolemy]
    * c93e405 2015-04-28 | Passed test: that it can "Buzz" when passed a number divisible by 5 [Ptolemy]
    * 6e0d292 2015-04-28 | Refactor code to Fizz on any number divisible by 3 [Ptolemy]
    * d6a8416 2015-04-28 | Passed first test: that it can 'Fizz' [Ptolemy]
    * 1eb35e2 2015-04-28 | Wrote first test: that it can 'fizz' [Ptolemy]
    * d9a5ca9 2015-04-28 | Added fizzbuzz-spec.rb [Ptolemy]
    * 1646ea1 2015-04-28 | Initializes Rspec [Ptolemy]
